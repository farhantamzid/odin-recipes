    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      The Apple Spinach Salad is a refreshing and nutritious dish that combines
      the crispness of fresh spinach leaves with the sweet and tart flavors of
      apples. To prepare this salad, start by washing and drying a bunch of
      fresh spinach leaves, then thinly slice a couple of applesâ€”Granny Smith or
      Honeycrisp work well for their contrasting flavors. Toss the spinach and
      apple slices together in a large bowl, adding a handful of toasted pecans
      or walnuts for a delightful crunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To elevate the flavors, prepare a simple vinaigrette by whisking together
      olive oil, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper.
      Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad just before serving, ensuring
      everything is well-coated. For added texture and taste, sprinkle in some
      crumbled goat cheese or feta and dried cranberries. This Apple Spinach
      Salad is perfect as a light lunch or a vibrant side dish for any meal.
