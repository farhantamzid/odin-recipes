    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta with a rich
      meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey cheese. To make a traditional
      lasagna, start by preparing a hearty meat sauce with ground beef, onions,
      garlic, and tomatoes, seasoned with Italian herbs like basil and oregano.
      Simmer the sauce until it’s thick and flavorful. Meanwhile, cook the
      lasagna noodles until al dente and prepare the béchamel sauce by melting
      butter, whisking in flour to create a roux, and slowly adding milk until
      it thickens into a smooth, creamy sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom
      of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles. Next, add another layer
      of meat sauce, a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and
      a drizzle of béchamel. Repeat these layers until all the ingredients are
      used, finishing with a final layer of cheese on top. Bake the lasagna in a
      preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes, or until the top is
      golden and bubbly. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing to allow
      the layers to set, ensuring every bite is a perfect blend of flavors and
      textures.
